* Cross Site Request Forgery :

  	application should generate a random token and store it in the session
	Whenever any form is displayed to the user, the token should be present in the page as a hidden input field. 
	Application logic must check for the token and ensure that it matches the token present in the session. 


* Encryption is reversible whereas hashing is irreversible

	Black hat hackers are those who hack without authority. 
	White hat hackers are authorised to perform a hacking attempt under signed NDA. 
	Grey hat hackers are white hat hackers which sometimes perform unauthorised activities.

* A firewall is a device that allows/blocks traffic as per defined set of rules. 

* Port scanning is process of sending messages in order to gather information about network, 
  system etc. by analysing the response received.


* VA (Vulnerability Assessment) : exploitable vulnerabilities like a real attacker will do

* DDoS stands for distributed denial of service. When a network/server/application 
  is flooded with large number of requests which it is not 
  designed to handle making the server unavailable to the legitimate requests.

* SQL Injection (SQLi) : SQL commands these strings can be entered in places like search boxes, 
			 login forms, and even directly into a url to negate simple client-side

* Cross site scripting : 

	is a JavaScript vulnerability in the web applications. 
	The easiest way to explain this is a case when a user enters a script in the client side input 
	fields and that input gets processed without getting validated.

* Brute Force : 

  More sophisticated Brute Force attacks compile password lists from keywords available on your website 
  to test on your administrator login forms. The best way to protect yourself is by always using strong, 
  unique passwords and supplementing your access control with Two Factor authentication.


* path injection : 
  
  path injection is url link
  
* Secure session :
  
* Malware and unwanted programs can use browser hijacking to steal a browser's cookie files without a user's knowledge.
  mcrypt or a custom AES encryption to encrypt session data.


* What is the difference between encryption and hashing?
  
  Encryption is reversible whereas hashing is irreversible.
  
* Spear phishing : attack by high volume of phising

* What is a pentest?
  hack after 3rd party integration library or framwork
  
* Phishing is the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information 
  such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details 

* Clickjacking : clicking on a button that appears to perform another function

* Baiting : curiosity or greed of the victim

* WAF stands for web application firewall. It is used to protect the 
  application by filtering legitimate traffic from malicious traffic
  
* What are you favourite security testing tools?

* social engineering : users are tricked into clicking on a malicious link they think came from a Facebook friend or LinkedIn connection.

* When you log on to a PC with a user name and password you are authenticating. Authorization is the process of verifying that you have access to something

* two-factor authentication

* What are salted hashes : generating random data, and how it can be used to help store passwords more securely.

* Dictionary Attack : a guessing attack which uses precompiled list of option but Attempts to determine a secret by trying every possible combination. 

* What should you never record into a web app error log?
  
  passwords, credit card numbers, any other sensitive data...
  
* difference between a White Box test and a Black Box test?
  
* A replay attack (also known as playback attack) is a form of network attack in which a valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed.

* rainbow table?

* URL manipulations?

* Stack Trace : in 200 sucess hacker get class name or method name
