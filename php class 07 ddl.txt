** create accounts table add user_id 

** ADD FOREIGN KEY :

SHOW CREATE TABLE tablename;

take the constraint datat_ibfk_1



alter table tablename

 show databases 
 
 show tables * from php_practise 

 
 name from php_practise limit 30

 (1st is starting point 2nd is how many we want to show) 

 
 order by name 
 
 (its show the name by order acc to dec) 

 
 order by name desc 
   
 (its show the name by order dec to asc)

 
 multiple order by id,name 
 
 (its show the name & id both by order acc to dec) 
 
 
 order by name desc limit 1 
 
 (its show the last name by order dec to asc) 

 
 ORDER BY time DESC 
 
 (its show the lastest date data)

 group by name 


 SELECT sum|avg|COUNT(sub_total) 
 
 FROM table name;
 
 (get total of any colomn)
 
 
 SELECT * FROM products WHERE

 AND end_time  <= '2017-06-04'
 
 






_______________________________________



TEXT :
____


in varchar max length 65000 char. if you want more than that you can use text.

on more thing it can have default value null. but varchar anything you want.



TEXT have 4 type :


TINYTEXT 	:	Holds a string with a maximum length of 255 characters

MEDIUMTEXT	:	Holds a string with a maximum length of 16,777,215 characters
	
	
	
_______________________________________	
	

	
	
** charecter (lenght depends on allias)


	char 2 byte  
	
	* CHAR field is a fixed length
	
	* fast if rows are of the same length

	
	varchar 2 byte :
	
	max 65000 charecter
	
	VARCHAR is a variable length field
	


   nvarchar not available in mysqli.
   
   it use for support all language.
   
   set Collation to utf8_croatian_ci



** Date :

	year 1 byte

	date 3 byte [2017-05-24]

	time 3 byte [5:59:35] 

	datetime 8 byte [2017-05-24 07:46:42]  

	timestamp 4 bytes 

	TIMESTAMP has a range of '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-19 03:14:07' UTC

	[2017-05-24 07:46:42]




Decimal :



*float(5,2) [4 byte]

(total 5, decimel 2)



built in take 4 digit after decimel


BLOB:

A blob is a data type that can store binary data. This is different than most other data types used in databases, such as integers, floating point numbers, characters, and strings, which store letters and numbers. Since blobs can store binary data, they can be used to store images or other multimedia files.

BLOB stores binary data which are more than 2 GB. Max size for BLOB is 4 GB. Binary data means unstructured data i.e images audio files vedio files digital signature

STUDY :






PRIMARY KEY (AVOID DUPLICATE ENTRY FOR KEY)

You can only have one primary key, 

but you can have multiple columns

cannot be NULL


ALTER TABLE tablename DROP PRIMARY KEY;




unique key (AVOID DUPLICATE ENTRY FOR VALUE)

You can only have many unique key,

- can have null value




* There are three types of on delete associated with foreign key


-On Delete Cascade: when data is removed from a parent table, 
 automatically data deleted from child table (foreign key table).

-On Delete set Null: when data is removed from a parent table, 
 the foreign key associated cell will be null in a child table.

-On Delete Restrict: when data is removed from a parent table, 
 and there is a foreign key associated with child table it 
 gives error, you can not delete the record.




** Foreign key must be int

** must be signed

** must not insert data in 

   reference table before set foreign key


ALTER TABLE insert_data 

add FOREIGN KEY(country_id)

REFERENCES apps_countries(id)


** ERRORS :

Cannot add or update a child row -> 

just truncate 2 table



Hadop - 


Java open source Linux platform framework.
Process all stuctured unstructured & bulk data.
1st process then store data. 
For processing have many computer. 
All computer have master & slave computer




Cluster:

Need to develop :

  cluster: https://ndimensionz.com/kb/what-is-database-clustering-introduction-and-brief-explanation/

  bcnf & 4nf , online transaction processing (oltp) database, active records

  more complex join
