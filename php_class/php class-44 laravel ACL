* php artisan make:auth

* Laravel’s authentication facilities are made up of “guards” and “providers”.

* The guard defines the logic of authentication

* Providers fetch data from database

* enter the custom guard details in the config/auth.php

‘providers’=> [
        'users' => [
            'driver' => 'eloquent',
            'model' => App\User::class,
        ],
        'admins' => [
            'driver' => 'eloquent',
            'model' => App\Admin::class,
        ],
]

* We can use this guards using Auth::guard('admin').
