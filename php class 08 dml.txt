SELECT DATA :
___________


WORK WITH :

country phone codes sql

country name sql


(operator selector) :

 1. 
 
 
 show databases 

 
 2. 
 
 
 show tables 

 
 3. 
 
 
 * from php_practise 

 
 4. 
 
 
 name from php_practise 

 
 5. 
 
 limit 30 
 
 (limit data number) 

	
 6. 
 
 
 limit 13,2 
 
 (1st is starting point 2nd is how many we want to show) 

	
 7. 
 
 
 order by name 
 
 (its show the name by order acc to dec) 

	
 8. 
 
 
 order by name desc 
 
   
 (its show the name by order dec to asc)

   
 9. 
 
 multiple order by id,name 
 
 (its show the name & id both by order acc to dec) 
 
 
 10. 
 
 
 order by name desc limit 1 
 
 (its show the last name by order dec to asc) 

	
 11. 
 
 ORDER BY time DESC 
 
 (its show the lastest date data) 

	
 12. 
 
 where id='50' 
 
 (its show only limit data number. total 30 data) 

	
 13. where id !='50' 

 
 14. where id > '50' 

 
 15. id < '50' 

 
 16. id >= '50' 

 
 17. where id <= '50' 

 
 18. 
 
 where name BETWEEN 10 AND 20 
 
 (its show only between 10 to 20 id number data 30) 

	
 19. 
 
 where name like 'ban%' 
 
 (its show anything who start with ban , % is wildcard) 

 
 20. 
 
 where id like '_1' | where nmae like '__1'
 
 (its show one single number have before 1. ITS DEALS ONLY WITH NUMBER) 

 
 21. 
 
 
 where id like 'b%h'  
 
 (its show which have first letter b and last letter h )

 
 22. 
 
 
 group by name 
 
 (show it like facebook chat)
 
 
 GROUP BY lets you use aggregate functions, 
 
 like AVG, MAX, MIN, SUM, and COUNT. 
 
 Other hand DISTINCT just removes duplicates.

 
 23. 
 
 
 SELECT sum|avg|COUNT(sub_total) 
 
 FROM table name;
 
 
 (get total of any colomn)

 
 24. 
 
 
 SELECT * FROM products WHERE 
 
 start_date >= '2017-06-03' 
 
 AND end_time  <= '2017-06-04'
 
 
 
 
 
 
WORKING WITH 2 TABLE :->



MAKE TWO TABLE FIELD INTO 1 FIELD: 


SELECT * FROM datat
WHERE id = 1

UNION ALL

SELECT * FROM helo1
WHERE id = 1



** LEFT JOIN :
_____________


common data from left table

ALL data from SELECT table


SELECT *

FROM data

LEFT JOIN data2

ON data.id=data2.nameid



** right join :


all data from right table

common data from SELECT table



** inner join :

bring all common data from 2 table






TRIGGER :
_______

 

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
 
BEFORE/AFTER (when trigger function will apply)

INSERT/UPDATE  (which sql query trigger will apply)  

ON table_name

FOR EACH ROW

SET new.fullname = CONCAT(new.fname,'  ',new.lname),

SET new.fname = 'abc'

____


show TRIGGERS FROM database_name

drop trigger trigger_name

____


arethmetic operator in sql : new.ext +-/* new.number

AFTER INSERT ON table_name FOR EACH ROW

INSERT INTO total_number VALUES('',CONCAT(new.fname,'  ',new.lname));




** work with single trigger

** work with multiple trigger

** work with after insert another table




rules :

trigger is nothing but set a sql function. 

it will auto add fname & lname then make fullname.

first goto databse. then paste the query.


1. SET before for trigger & insert in same table

   (before make the function first. then insert data into table)
   
2. SET after for trigger & insert in different table

   (after make the function after insert. then insert data into table)
   
3. new keyword for assign in fieldname

4. INSERT/UPDATE ON table_name (which sql query trigger will execute) 

5. multple trigger just comma



____


store procedure :


CREATE PROCEDURE select_name()

BEGIN

   SELECT * FROM abc
   
END

CALL select_name()


DROP PROCEDURE procude_name;

show procedure status;


____



store a query in procedure name. call it when you want.

Stored procedures are stored as precompilated code.

Stored procedure can return value  but trigger cannt.

execute store procedure by call keyword.

trigger auto call but procedure need to call
